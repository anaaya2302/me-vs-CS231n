# me-vs-CS231n
Hii! This a personal repo documenting my slow descent into madness while going through Stanford's CS231n. ( On hard mode 'cause apparently high schoolers can't officially enroll. crying emoji, crying emoji ). Not a roadmap or a 
tutorial... just my notes, questions, diagrams and jokes ( to hide my tears ). It's a work in slow progress

## Why?
Because I like writing stuff down. Plus, I think my notes are high key slay, and if they save someone a few tears over a Jacobian Matrix, that's a major win. To whoever's reading this: if you want to throw 
your laptop across the room- please don't. You got this. Not scared. 

## What's here?
- **notes/** - Breakdowns of lectures, concepts and diagrams in my own words. ( Fair warning: my commentary is in places... colorful. )
- **utils/** - Small tricks, sanity checks and some code snippets I found cool or helpful.
- **scratchpad/** - Random thoughts, experiments... basically stuff too good to delete too messy to sort. ( Read at your own risk... handwritten in places )

## What's not here?
No assignment or code solutions. That's Stanford's problem. Just approaches and notes.

## Final thoughts
I'm a high schooler doing CS231n for fun (??). ( Don't ask... or actually, if you're curious - dm me on insta: @anaayajaryal ). Anyways, I thought my notes and spirals deserved a repo. If you got something useful out
of this, AWESOME. If not, I hope I alteast made you laugh.
